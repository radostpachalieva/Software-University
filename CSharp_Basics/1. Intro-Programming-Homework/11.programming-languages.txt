There is lost of information about the most popular programming language. Almost in every article/chart we can see
that on the top there are same languages. The popularity of a language depend of the needs of the users/customers.
"Financial and enterprise systems need to perform complicated functions and remain highly organized,
requiring languages like Java and C#. Media- and design-related web pages and software will require 
dynamic, versatile and functional languages with minimal code, such as Ruby, PHP, JavaScript and Objective-C."

So these are the most popular programming languages:
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language. It's one of the most in-demand programming languages, 
a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the Android operating system. 
Java is designed to work across multiple software platforms, meaning a program written on Mac OS X, for example, 
could also run on Windows. 

/It's a deeply featured class-based, object-oriented programming language that's designed to be portable and 
workable on as many platforms as possible./ - The same like the top!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Java isn't a perfect programming language though—many schools and classes start with C or C++ because Java 
gets a lot of its syntax from those earlier languages. Those of you who championed Java as a good first language noted that 
Java forces you to think like a programmer—to think logically and analytically, and really grasp how a computer will 
process information in order to be successful. 

The special thing about Java is that this is the first purely object oriented programming language!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
Java was developed on the principle of WORA i.e. “Write Once Run Anywhere”.

Applications and Program development

Game development
Java language is used to develop enterprise level application and video games; 
it can be employed to develop web based applications when used with JSP (Java Server Pages). 

Internet and web page development

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C Language
A general-purpose, imperative programming language developed in the early '70s, C is the oldest and most widely used language, 
providing the building blocks for other popular languages, such as C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. C is mostly used for 
implementing operating systems and embedded applications. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It provides the foundation for many other languages.

C, and then of C++ (which started off as a set of improvements and updates to bring C into modern applications), 
let's just say that both languages have been around since the 1970s and early 80s. C, for its part, is an extremely 
widely-used, general purpose, imperative programming language that's heavily influenced almost every language that's 
followed it. C++ on the other hand took things a step further, added object-oriented features like classes to the language, 
along with virtual functions and templates. C++ is another of the world's most popular programming languages, and is still 
in wide use today in everything from video games to productivity software. C++ is a bit more difficult to pick up than C, 
although many people would argue that there's no reason to start with C anymore at all.

Applications and Program development
Artificial Intelligence development
Game development
Computer drivers or other hardware interface development

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++
C++ is an intermediate-level language with object-oriented programming features, originally designed to enhance the C language.
It's used to develop systems software, application software, high-performance server and client applications and video games.

Applications and Program development
Artificial Intelligence development
Game development

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C#
C# is a multi-paradigm language. Combining principles from C and C++, C# is a general-purpose language used to develop software 
for Microsoft and Windows platforms.

C# is very similar to Java in terms of capabilities. It has been said that C# combines the robustness of C++ with 
the advanced features of Java.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective-C
Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used by the Apple operating system. 
It powers Apple's OS X and iOS, as well as its APIs, and can be used to create iPhone apps, which has generated 
a huge demand for this once-outmoded programming language.

The purpose of developing Objective-C programming language was to address the deficiencies in C language.
The major shortcoming in C language was object orientation which provoked many developers to devise languages that 
incorporate object orientation paradigm. As a result C++ and Object-C were developed. However, the latter have 
gained immense popularity owing to its use in developing applications for Apple’s iPhone and iPad.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHP
PHP (Hypertext Processor) is a free, server-side scripting language designed for dynamic websites and app development. 
It can be directly embedded into an HTML source document rather than an external file, which has made it 
a popular programming language for web developers. 

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is one of the most widely used languages used to develop dynamic websites. 
PHP was developed in 1995 and is a server-side scripting language which means that PHP code is processed on the server 
and end result is sent to the user of the website in the form of plain HTML.
PHP is an open-source language which means that there are thousands of already built modules that can be modified 
to achieve the desired functionality. 

Internet and web page development

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python
Python is a high-level, server-side scripting language for websites and mobile apps. It's considered a fairly easy language 
due to its readability and compact syntax, meaning developers can use fewer lines of code to express a concept than they would 
in other languages. 

Python is usually used and referred to as a scripting language, allowing programmers to churn out large quantities of easily readable 
and functional code in short periods of time, but it's also dynamic, and supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming 
styles, among others. Thanks to its flexibility, Python is one of the most widely used high-level programming languages today. 

Python is another high-level programming language and is often considered on the easiest language to learn, owing to its simplicity, 
readability and straight forward syntax.

Like, PHP, Python also has associated web frameworks which make it more convenient to develop web based applications in python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby
A dynamic, object-oriented scripting language for developing websites and mobile apps, Ruby was designed to be simple and easy to write. 
Like Python, Ruby is considered a fairly user-friendly language.

Ruby is a dynamic, open-source, object-oriented programming language. It was designed to have syntax that was easy to read and 
to write by mere humans, without necessarily needing to learn a massive base of commands and specialized "vocabulary" in order 
to get started.

Similar to Python, Ruby is also a simple and readable programming language mainly focused on developing web-based applications.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript
JavaScript is a client and server-side scripting language that derives much of its syntax from C. It can be used across 
multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web functions. It is also used in 
game development and writing desktop applications.


Server side languages are ideal for developing complex web applications but performing every task on server puts lots of load 
on a server. For this reason, developers often delegate some part of the functionality to client side and for this purpose 
JavaScript is used. JavaScript is a client side programming language that runs inside a client browser and process commands 
on client computer rather than server which results in decreased load on server and increased application’s execution speed. 

JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, is a scripting language. JavaScript is one of the fundamental technologies on which 
the web as we know it is based. Don't be fooled though—JavaScript exists outside of the browser as well, but largely in the context 
of connected applications and services. The language itself is dynamic, and gives programmers the flexibility to use object-oriented 
programming styles (as the language itself is mostly object oriented) as well as functional and imperative ones. 
It derives much of its syntax from C, and if you plan to do any development for the web in any fashion.

SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special-purpose language for managing data in relational database management systems. 
It is most commonly used for its "Query" function, which searches informational databases. 

SQL is not a development language; it is actually a database query language. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
SQL provides a standardized way of interacting with the underlying database of an application. SQL is extremely simple to learn 
and is probably closest to the English language in terms of syntax. Almost every application has a backend database and
in order to interact with that you will need to have sound knowledge of SQL.
