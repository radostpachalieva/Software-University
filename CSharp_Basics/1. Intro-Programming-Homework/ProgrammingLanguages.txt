Problem 11.	Programming Languages
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about 
the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#? 
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 
sentences about each of them. Use English.

There is lost of information about the most popular programming languages. Almost in every article/chart we can see
that the tops are same languages. The popularity of a language depend of the needs of the users/customers.
"Financial and enterprise systems need to perform complicated functions and remain highly organized,
requiring languages like Java and C#. Media- and design-related web pages and software will require 
dynamic, versatile and functional languages with minimal code, such as Ruby, PHP, JavaScript and Objective-C."

So these are the most popular programming languages:

Java
It's a deeply featured class-based, object-oriented programming language that's designed to be portable and 
workable on as many platforms as possible. Java gets a lot of its syntax from C or C++ languages.
Uses: Applications and Program development, Game development, Internet and web page development and more.

C Language
A general-purpose, imperative programming language. C is the oldest and most widely used language, providing the building 
blocks for other popular languages, such as C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. C is mostly used for implementing operating systems
and embedded applications. It provides the foundation for many other languages.
C, for its part, is an extremely widely-used, general purpose, imperative programming language that's heavily influenced 
almost every language that's followed it
Uses: Applications and Program development, Artificial Intelligence development, Game development, Computer drivers or 
other hardware interface development and more.

C++
C++ is an intermediate-level language with object-oriented programming features, originally designed to enhance the C language.
It started off as a set of improvements and updates to bring C into modern applications
C++ -- object-oriented features like classes to the language, along with virtual functions and templates. 
Uses: Applications and Program development, Artificial Intelligence development, Game development and more.

C#
C# is a multi-paradigm language. Combining principles from C and C++, C# is a general-purpose language used to develop software 
for Microsoft and Windows platforms. C# is very similar to Java in terms of capabilities. It has been said that C# combines 
the robustness of C++ with the advanced features of Java.
Uses: Applications and Program development, Artificial Intelligence development, Game development and more.

Objective-C
Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used by the Apple operating system. 
It powers Apple's OS X and iOS, as well as its APIs, and can be used to create iPhone apps, which has generated 
a huge demand for this once-outmoded programming language. The purpose of developing Objective-C programming language 
was to address the deficiencies in C language. The major shortcoming in C language was object orientation which 
provoked many developers to devise languages that incorporate object orientation paradigm. As a result C++ and 
Object-C were developed.

PHP
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is one of the most widely used languages used to develop dynamic websites. 
It is a server-side scripting language which means that PHP code is processed on the server and end result is sent 
to the user of the website in the form of plain HTML. PHP is an open-source language which means that there are 
thousands of already built modules that can be modified to achieve the desired functionality. 
Uses: Internet and dynamic web page development, App development and more.

Python
Python is a high-level, server-side scripting language. It's considered a fairly easy language due to its readability 
and compact syntax, meaning developers can use fewer lines of code to express a concept than they would in other languages.
Python is usually used and referred to as a scripting language, allowing programmers to churn out large quantities of easily 
readable and functional code in short periods of time, but it's also dynamic, and supports object-oriented, procedural, and 
functional programming styles, among others. Thanks to its flexibility, Python is one of the most widely used high-level 
programming languages today. 
Uses: Internet and web page development, Mobile apps, Script development and more.

JavaScript
JavaScript is a client side programming language that runs inside a client browser and process commands on client computer
rather than server which results in decreased load on server and increased application’s execution speed. It is one of the 
fundamental technologies on which the web as we know it is based. JavaScript exists outside of the browser as well, but 
largely in the context of connected applications and services. The language itself is dynamic, and gives programmers the 
flexibility to use object-oriented programming styles (as the language itself is mostly object oriented) as well as functional 
and imperative ones. It derives much of its syntax from C.
Uses: Internet and web page development, It can be used across multiple web browsers, For developing interactive or animated 
web functions, Game development Desktop applications and more.
